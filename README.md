# BTC-TRS: Bitcoin Wallet Heuristics Library

This repository is the open-source track of **MyCryptoTRS**, focused entirely on Bitcoin.

## Purpose
- Provide a **privacy-preserving, MIT-licensed heuristics library** for UTXO wallet health and safety analysis.
- Contribute **reviews, tests, and docs** upstream to Bitcoin Core as part of ongoing development.
- Publish transparent methodology docs to help wallets adopt best-practice hygiene scoring without compromising censorship resistance or privacy.

## Roadmap (12 months)
1. **Core Contributions**  
   - Participate in Bitcoin Core review, testing, and documentation improvements.  
2. **Library Development (MIT)**  
   - Implement heuristics for UTXO reuse, dust patterns, change handling, and consolidation hygiene.  
   - Release with full test vectors and fuzzing coverage.  
3. **CLI Tool (MIT)**  
   - Lightweight, offline scoring CLI for transparency and reproducibility.  
4. **Education & Transparency**  
   - Publish methodology notes, limitations, and tutorials for responsible use.
